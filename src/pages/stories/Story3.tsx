    translation="Bayaraa went to the market. He bought meat, bread, and vegetables. The mutton was expensive. But the vegetables were cheap. Bayaraa paid 10,000 tugriks.

Then he went to a shop and bought candy and biscuits. Bayaraa thought the candy was delicious.

In the evening, when he got home, Bayaraa cooked food. He made soup and gave it to his friend. His friend said: 'Thank you! It's delicious!'"
